Hey everyone! Thanks for visiting my website; I am currently in the process of building the site structure, adding files/images, and writing content for subpages. I added the blog section in here because this was built in from the "academicpages" theme that I forked from Github... We will see how many blog posts I actually make...

But I will say this: I did not realize how surprisingly easy it is to create your own website, particularly if you have a bit of familiarity with basic coding, markdown files, and git. If you already have a Github, you can use [Githhub pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host your static website for free by creating a repository with the naming convention "username.github.io". To make building your website easier, you can fork other repositories with website templates, for instance the very popular [academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) theme that I have seen other fellow graduate students use. To make things *even* easier, the "academicpages" template uses simplified markdown files to produce HTML/CSS files with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 

There are basic instructions on the [academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) repository, seen on the bottom of their Github page and on the [website itself](https://academicpages.github.io/) which has even more detailed instructions on each page. **I relied most heavily on the blog post by [Jay Williams](https://jayrobwilliams.com/posts/2020/06/academic-website/) where he gives a thorough, step-by-step description on how he created his own academicpages website from start to finish.** He also has several other posts on [how to use Jekyll](https://jayrobwilliams.com/posts/2020/09/jekyll-html) and [how to further modify website content](https://jayrobwilliams.com/posts/2020/08/website-content/).

While a lot of the website-making process has been simplified, it does still require some work and creativity (which honestly has been pretty fun so far). I would certainly encourage any graduate student or young academic to create there own website. This allows you to tell your full academic story without condensing into a resume or CV and allows you to visually show your skills/achievements in more than just text, which is likely more appealing to potential employers.
