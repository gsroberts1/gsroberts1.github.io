### Description
Annual UW-Madison MRI Group meeting to share findings or discuss relevant MRI topics. For this talk, I reviewed brain MR elastography (MRE), a technique that allows one to measure brain stiffness using MRI (crazy!). We recently collaborated with GE Healthcare and the Mayo Clinic to implement brain MRE at our institution. This talk was designed to provide background on our recently-implemented MRE technique for our MRI colleagues.
