This was our first oral presentation on the work that Anthony Peret and I have done on the [normative 4D flow study](https://gsroberts1.github.io/research/normals). This talk focused on methodology and basic statistics, specifically our custom [cranial 4D flow analysis tool](https://gsroberts1.github.io/research/qvt), intra/interobserver repeatability, normal flow ranges in older adults, and how flow and pulsatility change as we age. It was presented at [ISMRM](https://www.ismrm.org/) and was my first in-person oral presentation since COVID (had to shake the rust off). Anthony is currently preparing a similar talk for late August at ASFNR on the relationship between vascular risk factors and measured intracranial flow and pulsatility.
