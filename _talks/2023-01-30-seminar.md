### Description
4D flow MRI (time-resolved, volumetric, three-directional velocity-encoded MRI) is a powerful imaging method that can capture blood flow, vascular anatomy, and complex flow patterns in a single acquisition.

In the brain, 4D flow MRI can be used for quantifying cerebral blood flow, velocities, and pulsatility in normal and neurovascular disease populations, blood flow tracking in arteriovenous malformations, risk assessment of aneurysm rupture using wall shear stress calculations, and more. However, proper quantitative assessment usually requires tedious image post-processing, including segmentation, centerline skeletonization, placement of analysis planes for flow, and flow visualization. The first part of this educational talk aims to present software tools that we have developed to automate cranial 4D flow post-processing, allowing for fast, robust, and repeatable flow visualization and quantification. In the second part of the talk, we apply these tools to measure cerebral blood flow and pulsatility in a large population (n=759) of older adults to establish normal flow and pulsatility baseline values across as large age spectrum.
