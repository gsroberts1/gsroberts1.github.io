### Description
Annual UW-Madison MRI Group meeting to share findings or discuss relevant MRI topics. In this talk, I discuss the findings from our [chronic mesenteric ischemia study](https://gsroberts1.github.io/research/cmi). After eating a meal, blood flow to the gut normally increases. In patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI), this blood flow response is stunted, which can be caused by atherosclerotic narrowing, arteritis, or other pathologies that restrict blood flow. In this work, we use 4D flow MRI to measure mesenteric blood flow before and after a meal and show that blood flow is stunted in patients with CMI relative to controls, making 4D flow MRI a potential diagnostic tool.
