### Description
This was the second talk of our 2-part ADRC vascular imaging series. In the previous lecture, we discussed principles of flow imaging and results from recent studies. In this lecture, we focus on more advanced imaging methods to obtain non-conventional measures of: vessel stiffness, [brain tissue stiffness (MRE)](https://gsroberts1.github.io/research/mre), perfusion (ASL), and ways to assess glymphatics and the integrity of the blood brain barrier.
