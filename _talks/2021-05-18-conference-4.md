This oral presentation was given at [ISMRM](https://www.ismrm.org/) on the work related to the [NODDI - 4D Flow study](https://gsroberts1.github.io/research/noddi) that is still ongoing. In this talk, I focus on the relationship between macrovascular flow and pulsatility and observed white matter microstructure in normal subjects and Alzheimer's disease subjects.
