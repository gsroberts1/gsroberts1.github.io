### Description
I presented an abstract as a second author (originally submitted by my advisor Laura Eisenmenger) on the use of 4D flow-generated [virtual injections](https://gsroberts1.github.io/research/inject) for use in venous mapping of arteriovenous malformations (AVM). AVMs range from benign to very high risk, depending on the size, location, number of feeding vessels, etc. Because of this, they can difficult to manage and treat. [Transvenous embolization](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5624411/) has recently emerged as a promising surgical approach to treat AVMs. In this presentation, we discuss the promise of our virtual injection technique (using forward/reverse injections) in an AVM case at our institution.
