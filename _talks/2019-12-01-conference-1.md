### Description
This educational talk was given by Carson Hoffman at RSNA in 2019. This talk was targetted towards clinicians or those new to the field of MRI in hopes of providing context and clarity to the naming conventions of common MRI sequences. Sequences are typically abbreviated with similar letters, and to add to the confusion, MRI vendors often abbreviate the same sequence differently, leading to a mountain of abbreviations that one has to learn. We conceived of the idea earlier that year and performed multiple scans on phantoms to visualize basic MRI sequences, explain what they tell us, and provide vendor-specific abbreviations for thesse sequences. It was well-received and won a certificate of merit award.
