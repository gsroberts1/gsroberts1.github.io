As an undergraduate student, I obtained a bachelor’s degree in Radiological Science in 2014 at the University of Missouri – Columbia. I worked as an x-ray and CT technologist at the University of Missouri Hospital system for several years before deciding to pursue Medical Physics. In 2017, I obtained a bachelor’s degree in Physics from the University of Missouri – Kansas City being advised by [Tony Caruso](https://sse.umkc.edu/profiles/caruso-anthony.html) and mentored by [Fred Leibsle](https://sse.umkc.edu/profiles/leibsle-fred.html). 

In 2017, I was accepted into the Medical Physics Program at the University of Wisconsin – Madison where I joined [Oliver Wieben's](https://www.medphysics.wisc.edu/blog/staff/wieben-oliver/) lab as a graduate student and was co-mentored by [Laura Eisenmenger](https://radiology.wisc.edu/profile/laura-eisenmenger-2119/) in 2018. My primary research focus was developing, validating, and applying [phase contrast MRI](https://mriquestions.com/phase-contrast-mra.html) (with radially-undersampled accelerated acquisition techniques) to study cardiovascular and cerebrovascular hemodynamics in the context of aging and dementia. Along the way, I developed several post-processing tools for analyzing and visualizing 2D phase contrast and 4D flow MRI data. 

This has led me to my current role as a data scientist at [NeoSoft](https://neosoftllc.com/) starting in April 2023, where I will be working with a team of experts to help develop software for their 4D flow MRI package as part of their cardiac MRI suite.
