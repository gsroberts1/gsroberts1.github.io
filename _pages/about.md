Grant is a PhD candidate in the department of Medical Physics at the University of Wisconsin – Madison and is co-advised by [Oliver Wieben](https://www.medphysics.wisc.edu/blog/staff/wieben-oliver/), PhD and [Laura Eisenmenger](https://radiology.wisc.edu/profile/laura-eisenmenger-2119/), MD. His primary research focus is developing, validating, and applying [phase contrast MRI](https://mriquestions.com/phase-contrast-mra.html) to study vascular health. He has developed tools and processing pipelines for analyzing and visualizing 2D phase contrast and 4D flow MRI. His current project is on developing and validating a simultaneous multislice radial 2D phase contrast pulse sequence for measuring aortic pulse wave velocity (related to aortic stiffness) and assessing the correlation between central arterial stiffness and cerebral hemodynamics. 

Previously, he obtained a bachelor’s degree in Radiological Science in 2014 at the University of Missouri – Columbia. He then worked as an x-ray and CT technologist at the University of Missouri Hospital system for several years before deciding to pursue Medical Physics. In 2017, he obtained a bachelor’s degree in Physics from the University of Missouri – Kansas City being advised by [Tony Caruso](https://cas.umkc.edu/profiles/physics-and-astronomy/anthony-caruso.html), PhD and mentored by [Fred Leibsle](https://cas.umkc.edu/profiles/physics-and-astronomy/fred-leibsle.html), PhD. 

After graduation, he looks forward to continuing his career in MRI and data science in an industry position. Feel free to contact him with any questions or potential collaborations.
