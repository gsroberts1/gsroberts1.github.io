Background
------
My advisor, Laura Eisenmenger, was invited to write a review paper in NeuroGraphics following her well-received RSNA presentation on our institutional FAST neuro MRI protocol. I was tasked with writing the following sections: *Methods - General Imaging Consideration* and *Future Directions* (focusing on artificial intelligence applied to accelerating MRI acquisition and post-processing). Anthony Peret and I jointly developed CME questions and learning objectives for this review paper.

Here is the abstract for this paper:
> MRI has experienced extensive growth in both technical development and clinical applications, establishing MRI as one of the most powerful diagnostic tools for imaging. However, long examination and interpretation times still limit the application of MRI, especially in emergent clinical settings. Rapid and abbreviated MRI protocols have been developed as an alternative to standard MRI, with reduced imaging times and, in some cases, limited numbers of sequences to more efficiently answer specific clinical questions. Our family of rapid MRI protocols use the acronym FAST, for Focused Abbreviated Survey Technique, designed to include or exclude emergent or urgent conditions or screen for specific entities. Our FAST protocols provide adequate diagnostic image quality while using accelerated approaches to produce examinations faster than traditional methods. FAST protocols have become critical diagnostic screening tools at our institution, allowing confident yet efficient confirmation or exclusion of actionable findings. In this article, we will discuss the techniques commonly employed to reduce imaging times, review the imaging protocols we use at our institution, and discuss future directions in FAST imaging to provide a practical and comprehensive overview of FAST imaging for the practicing neuroradiologist.
