Background
------
My advisor, Laura Eisenmenger, was invited to write a review paper in NeuroGraphics following her RSNA presentation on our institutional FAST neuro MRI protocol. For this review, I wrote the following sections: *Methods - General Imaging Consideration* and *Future Directions* (focusing on artificial intelligence applied to accelerating MRI acquisition and post-processing). Anthony Peret and I jointly developed CME questions and learning objectives for this review paper.
