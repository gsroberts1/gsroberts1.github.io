Background
------
Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) is a disease caused by inadequate blood flow to the intestines. This study investigated the use of 4D flow MRI to non-invasively assess the hemodynamics of mesenteric circulation in patients with CMI. Flow was measured in 9 vessels before and after meal challenges for 19 subjects suspected of CMI and 6 controls. Post-prandial flow increased significantly in the supraceliac aorta, superior mesenteric artery, superior mesenteric vein, and portal vein. The flow increase was drastically less in patients with CMI. This demonstrates the potential for 4D flow MRI in assisting the challenging diagnosis of CMI.
