#### Compressed Sensing MRE
MR elastography (MRE) is a medical imaging technique that is particularly useful in quantifying mechanical properties of tissues by producing a stiffness map (elastogram). Recently, MRE has been applied to the brain to assess stiffness changes in various neurological conditions. Subsequently, compressive sensing (CS) is an image processing technique that aims to accurately reconstruct images from undersampled datasets, which can be used to shorten exam times or improve image quality. This paper aims to assess the feasibility of applying CS towards brain MRE exams. One fully-sampled brain MRE was acquired. K-space data was pseudo-randomly undersampled retrospectively and l^1-wavelet regularized reconstruction was performed. CS reconstructed data were further reconstructed to produce MR elastograms. It was shown using various image quality metrics that undersampling of up to 50% produced accurate MR elastograms.
