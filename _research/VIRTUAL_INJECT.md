Streamlines are a particularly useful tool for visualizing 3D velocity fields, such as those generated from 4D flow MRI. In the brain, streamlines have been used for visualizing complex flow patterns in aneurysms, studying intracarotid plaques, and characterizing cerebrovascular malformations. However, both displacement artifacts (deterministic) and velocity noise (stochastic) inherently degrade the quality of streamlines. The purpose of this study was to try and improve 4D flow streamlines by integrating several correction methods and constraints to improve selective blood flow tracking and emulate “virtual injections”.
