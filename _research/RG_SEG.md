Segmentation is a vital task in modern medical image processing that serves to reduce data analysis only to specific subregions that are of clinical interest. Advances in medical imaging technologies have provided the medical and scientific communities with larger datasets of ever-increasing image quality. There is an inherent need for robust segmentation methods that can extract clinically important information automatically, as opposed to performing time-consuming manual segmentation which is still done today in some clinical applications. The goal of this project was two-fold â€“ (1) to recreate a multi-stage segmentation algorithm that combines both region-growing with a simplified Mumford-Shah (SMS) functional and (2) to develop a novel region-growing algorithm using the same formulation but with added flexibility in initialization conditions and adjustments to the cost function calculation, in hopes of increasing efficiency and accuracy.
