The effect of aging and cardiovascular disease plays an important role in progressive arterial stiffening that can be observed in older adults. When arteries become stiffer and less compliant, they cannot absorb pulsatile energy (systolic pressure) generated from the heart. This ultimately puts stress on smaller arteries (capillaries) that are not well suited for dissipating this energy. This can cause damage to peripheral organs, like the brain, kidneys, eyes, and hear. To measure arterial stiffness, one biomarker that has recently emerged is pulse wave velocity (PWV). PWV indirectly assesses vessel stiffness by measuring how fast blood pressure pulsations travel through larger arteries; stiffer arteries lead to faster traveling pressure waves. This method has become the gold-standard for non-invasively assessing arterial stiffness, which has proven to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk and mortality. Because larger, more elastic arteries have a more active role in absorbing pulse pressures, PWV is most often measured in the aorta and its immediate branches.

NOTE: A simple experiment to illustrate arterial PWV can be performed by placing one finger on your carotid artery near your neck and the other finger near your ankle where you can find a pulse. By feeling the pulse at both locations, you should notice a time delay in blood pulsations, which is exactly what PWV is. The difference in distances between the heart and these locations, as well as the stiffness of your vessels, determines this time delay. 

Typically, arterial (aortic) PWV is measured by obtaining blood flow or pressure waveforms in the carotid and femoral arteries using tonometry, blood pressure cuffs, or ultrasound. Time delays/shifts (Δt) between these waveforms are calculated using mathematical methods. The faster the pulse pressure travels between these points, the shorter the time delay in the waveforms, which implies higher PWV, which again implies stiffer vessels. However, time delays are also a function of the distance, specifically, a vessel distance between the heart and each carotid/femoral measurement point (dcar/dfem). To account for this, we calculate velocity based on the difference in distance (Δd = dcar/dfem) between measurements (where aortic PWV = Δd/Δt). Distances are roughly estimated by measuring certain landmarks on the surface of the body using tape measures. While these approaches have been used successfully in many studies, the distance measurements are often prone to error because aorta morphology can vary from patient to patient. 

More recently, MRI has been used to evaluate aortic PWV with the use of cardiac-gated 2D phase contrast (2DPC) techniques. Phase contrast MRI allows us to measure blood velocities and flow waveforms over the cardiac cycle and has been used to obtain flow waveforms in the aorta, similar to tonometry and ultrasound techniques. However, unlike more traditional methods, MRI can directly obtain angiographic images of the aorta to compute aortic distances directly and much more accurately determined. However, this approach is still challenging because it requires high temporal resolution to resolve sometimes subtle waveform time shifts. Higher temporal resolutions increase the overall scan time, which is especially problematic because these exams are done while the subject is holding their breath. This is because the aorta can move during respiration which can result in image artifacts. However, in some subjects such as elderly, diseased, or cognitively-impaired individuals, long (or even short) breath-holds may be difficult or impossible. Developing high temporal resolution, free-breathing PWV methodologies would thus be ideal.

Also discuss the use of QA method.

In March 2021, I was awarded a 2-year F31 fellowship through the NIA (F31AG071183). This research project is dedicated towards developing and validating a free-breathing, radial 2DPC simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) sequence with local low rank reconstructions to generate high temporal resolution images for accurate aortic PWV measurements. In addition, a robust post-processing analysis platform has been developed for automated, and repeatable PWV measures to enable analysis in large cohort studies, several of which are currently underway at the Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC). The new imaging protocol will be used in a pilot study consisting of an AD cohort and an age- and sex-matched control group to collectively assess systemic cardiovascular health, macrovascular, and microvascular dynamics in the brain for the first time. This knowledge will help elucidate the role that the vascular system plays in pathogenesis and progression of AD.
