AD is commonly thought of as a brain-specific disease, however, recent evidence is beginning to suggest that cerebrovascular and cardiovascular risk factors may also play a critical role in the progression of AD. In early stages of AD, vascular changes occur before cognitive impairment and before detectable increases in CSF levels of amyloid-beta and tau proteins. Despite this, relatively little attention has been dedicated towards developing a comprehensive understanding of how both systemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease contribute towards AD-related pathophysiology.  In order to better understand this potential relationship, we need sensitive, non-invasive imaging methods to evaluate early-stage systemic cardiovascular changes.
