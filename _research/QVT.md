4D Flow MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique that enables the characterization of vascular anatomy and hemodynamics over a large imaging volume of interest. Detailed, multi-segmental analysis of the brain has been hindered by the complex cranial vasculature and long post processing times. Here we introduce an extension to a previously established 4D flow post processing tool1 that automatically segments and quantifies hemodynamic parameters in all vessel segments without the need for user interaction. This simplified post processing pipeline allows for robust and repeatable analysis and provides users the ability to easily visualize and quantify complex cranial 4D flow datasets.
